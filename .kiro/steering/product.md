# Product Overview

This is a demonstration project for deploying Rust-based AWS Lambda functions using AWS CDK.

The project showcases how to build and deploy serverless Rust functions with infrastructure as code, using the `cargo-lambda-cdk` construct library. The demo function writes incoming requests to an S3 bucket, demonstrating AWS SDK integration from Rust Lambda functions.
